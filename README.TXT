All you need to run our project is to download and run it. We use Jupyter Notebook as environment.
To run conf_matrix you need to install confusion_matrix using this command "pip install confusion_matrix"

All the text file is located in the bbc folder. The bbc folder should be placed in the same folder as the miniproject.ipynb file
